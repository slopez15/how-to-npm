//could convert this code to view pkg version currently up remotely in npm
	npm view <pkg> version
	cat package.json | grep name | awk -F: '{print $2}' //to get pkg name correctly all the time.
	//npm ls is one possible solution, but incorrect since gives npm @scope/name@version locally, not 
remotely
